# Lung Cancer Subtype Analysis
### Exploring the Cause of Survival Disparities in EGFR-mutated Lung Cancer Subtypes: Unraveling Distinctive Genomic and Phenotypic Features of 19Del and L858R Mutation Subtypes 
Differences in the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) have been observed between lung cancer patients with 19 exon deletion (19Del) and L858R mutation. 
Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic analysis of the EGFR-mutated lung cancer subtypes reveals distinctive features of each subtype, laying the groundwork for subtype-specific treatment and care options for lung cancer patients. 
We investigate the multi-omics information from the TCGA LUAD dataset and validate it using the GEO (GSE190139, GSE147377) and MSK datasets. The code is to analysis the multi-omics data and predict tumor microenvironment.
